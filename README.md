# Scripts and executable files for ï£¿

Your can copy desired script to any location in your PATH
or install to ~/bin with [homeshick](https://github.com/antontsv/homeshick)

Some of the scripts are using `#!/usr/bin/env awesome-bash` shebang,
which requires [awesome-shell installation] (https://github.com/antontsv/awesome-shell#installation)

There scripts are designed for Mac OS only

if you use one-time [homeshick-based setup](https://git.io/all.files),
completion rules will be installed and kept up-to-date automatically
